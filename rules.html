							<h1>Competition rules</h1>
							<div class="rules-content">
								<strong>Duration</strong><br>
								SportsMaster 2025 will run from November 15, 2024 until the Melbourne Cup is run in
								November 2025.<br><br>
								<strong>Cost</strong><br>
								Entry fee is $20 per participant. Groups are allowed, but they can only enter as a
								single participant.<br><br>
								<strong>Events</strong><br>
								Participants will be required to predict the winners (or similar) of various sporting
								events throughout the competition period. The specific events and their schedules will
								be announced in advance.<br><br>
								<strong>Selections</strong><br>
								Participants are required to submit their selections via the provided platform before
								9pm November 15. No late entries are permitted. Changes to selections after the entry
								cut off date are not permitted.<br><br>

								Exemptions to selections after the entry cut off date are at the discretion of
								competition organisers and will be used for events such as horse racing or Olympics
								where final fields and qualifying are determined in the lead up to events. This will be
								explicitly specified for each impacted event via the selection platform.<br><br>

								Unless explicitly specified otherwise on an event, participants can only select one (1)
								winner (or similar).<br><br>
								<strong>Jokers</strong><br>
								Participants are required to select five (5) events as 'jokers'. Any event for which they
								select the correct winner (or similar) will double any points they are eligible
								for.<br><br>
								<strong>Points</strong><br>
								Each event is worth forty (40) points. If an event is correctly predicted by multiple
								participants, the forty (40) points are shared equally among them. Points are awarded to one (1)
								decimal place.<br><br>

								As mentioned above, if a participant has used a joker on a correctly predicted event
								outcome, any points that they are awarded will be doubled.<br><br>

								In the event of a draw/dead heat where more than one person/team/country shares the
								outcome required for the event (ie. two runners finish a race in exactly the same time),
								points will be awarded equally for all participants who correctly predicted any of the
								winning people/teams/countries. This does not include draws in sports such as cricket,
								soccer and AFL where draws are a legitimate result. Jokers used in events where there is
								a draw/dead heat are awarded points in the same fashion as above.<br><br>
								<strong>Outcomes</strong><br>
								Outcomes of events are based on the official results declared by the governing body of the event.
								These official results are final. In the event of any discrepancies between initial reports and 
								the final official results, the latter will always be used to determine the outcome of the event.<br><br>
								<strong>Prizes</strong><br>
								The participant with the highest total points at the end of the competition period will
								be declared the winner and grand poobah and receive first prize. In the event of a tie,
								the following tiebreakers will be applied in order:<br><br>

								<ul class="rules-list">
									<li>Number of correct predictions - The participant with the higher number of
										correct predictions will be ranked higher.</li>
									<li>Number of correct joker predictions - The participant with the higher number of
										correct predictions which they had a joker applied to will be ranked higher.
									</li>
									<li>Earliest correct prediction - The participant who made their first correct
										prediction earliest in the competition will be ranked higher.</li>
								</ul><br><br>

								Additional prizes are awarded for 2nd, 3rd and last places. Prizes are usually in the
								form of cash with amounts determined by the number of participants.<br><br>
								<strong>Modifications</strong><br>
								Organisers reserve the right to modify the rules or cancel the competition at any
								time.<br><br>
