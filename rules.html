            <strong>Duration</strong><br />SportsMaster 2026 will run from
            November 17, 2025 until the Melbourne Cup is run in November 2026.

            <strong>Cost</strong><br />Entry fee is $20 per participant. Groups
            are allowed, but they can only enter as a single participant.

        </li>
        <li class="cs-li">

            <strong>Events</strong><br />Participants will be required to
            predict the winners (or similar) of various sporting events
            throughout the competition period. The specific events and their
            schedules will be announced in advance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-li">
          <p>
            <strong>Selections</strong><br />Participants are required to submit
            their selections via the provided platform before 9pm November 15.
            No late entries are permitted. Changes to selections after the entry
            cut off date are not permitted. Exemptions to selections after the
            entry cut off date are at the discretion of competition organisers
            and will be used for events such as horse racing or Olympics where
            final fields and qualifying are determined in the lead up to events.
            This will be explicitly specified for each impacted event via the
            selection platform. Unless explicitly specified otherwise on an
            event, participants can only select one (1) winner (or similar).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-li">
          <p>
            <strong>Jokers</strong><br />Participants are required to select
            five (5) events as 'jokers'. Any event for which they select the
            correct winner (or similar) will double any points they are eligible
            for.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-li">
          <p>
            <strong>Points</strong><br />Each event is worth forty (40) points.
            If an event is correctly predicted by multiple participants, the
            forty (40) points are shared equally among them. Points are awarded
            to one (1) decimal place. As mentioned above, if a participant has
            used a joker on a correctly predicted event outcome, any points that
            they are awarded will be doubled. In the event of a draw/dead heat
            where more than one person/team/country shares the outcome required
            for the event (ie. two runners finish a race in exactly the same
            time), points will be awarded equally for all participants who
            correctly predicted any of the winning people/teams/countries. This
            does not include draws in sports such as cricket, soccer and AFL
            where draws are a legitimate result. Jokers used in events where
            there is a draw/dead heat are awarded points in the same fashion as
            above.

        <li class="cs-li">
          <p>
            <strong>Outcomes</strong><br />Outcomes of events are based on the
            official results declared by the governing body of the event. These
            official results are final. In the event of any discrepancies
            between initial reports and the final official results, the latter
            will always be used to determine the outcome of the event.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="cs-li">
          <p>
            <strong>Prizes</strong><br />The participant with the highest total
            points at the end of the competition period will be declared the
            winner and grand poobah and receive first prize. In the event of a
            tie, the following tiebreakers will be applied in order: Number of
            correct predictions - The participant with the higher number of
            correct predictions will be ranked higher. Number of correct joker
            predictions - The participant with the higher number of correct
            predictions which they had a joker applied to will be ranked higher.
            Earliest correct prediction - The participant who made their first
            correct prediction earliest in the competition will be ranked
            higher. Additional prizes are awarded for 2nd, 3rd and last places.
            Prizes are usually in the form of cash with amounts determined by
            the number of participants.
